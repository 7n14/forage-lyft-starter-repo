--Round 1 of Testing--
After fixing a few errors regarding wrong names of variables the test was able to run.
On run all test failed due to "TypeError: 'module' object is not callable".
Unsure what went wrong but i will try to fix it.

-Results-
Ran 19 tests in 0.005s
FAILED (errors=19)


--Round 2 of Testing--
Fixed the error from before but new errors were produced and lots of variation among the 19 tests.
Some erroers are about "TypeError: descriptor '__init__' requires a 'super' object but received a 'CapuletEngine" 
and others "TypeError: Car.__init__() takes 6 positional arguments but 7 were given".

Ran 19 tests in 0.052s
FAILED (errors=19)


--Round 3 of Testing--
Attept to fix errors with car factory failed. All of the other errosrs untouched.

-Results-
Ran 19 tests in 0.010s
FAILED (errors=19)


--Round 4 of Testing--
Attept to fixing all errors encountered and failed in fixing all .
Errors changed but to similar error message as before so little progress.

-Results-
Ran 19 tests in 0.010s
FAILED (errors=19)


--Round 5 of Testing--
Small debugs to everything but all failed to fix errors and only produced different errors of same nature.
A rewrite of code might be required due to bugs not being fixed easily and their might a flaw in the programs design.
Once rewrite is complete back to Testing

-Results-
Ran 19 tests in 0.014s
FAILED (errors=19)


--Round 6 of Testing--
This set of tests is after doing a big rewrite of code across the entire codebase.
Across all of test with any engine other that the sternman engine i think this due to mutiple __init__ and not the code not reconising the different number of parameters
But some test have succesed with the . being passes "EEEEEEEEFEE......EE"

-Results-
Ran 19 tests in 0.008s
FAILED (failures=1, errors=12)
6 successes


--Round 7 of Testing--
Fixed issue with mutiple __init__ of the super class of the engine, left the battery super.__init__ due to not having different types of batteries that dont go off years.
A small issue from test 6 about tests failing due to object not being the same.

-Results-
Ran 19 tests in 0.006s
FAILED (failures=6)


--Round 8 of Testing--
After researching on ways to test to see if the class are equal, I have removed the test_factory test case as its not a unit that needs to be tested
There is one remaining failure test with the test_car

-Results-
Ran 14 tests in 0.003s
FAILED (failures=1)


--Round 9 of Testing--
Testing is complete as all test have succesed and no more failures or errors

-Results-
Ran 14 tests in 0.001s
OK

#Tests after new criteria 
--Round 10 of Testing--
Didn't run due to error

-Results-
Ran 0 tests
Error


--Round 11 of Testing--
Same error occured across all of the tire tests
Additionally an error in a battery test popped up 

-Results-
Ran 19 tests in 0.006s
FAILED (failures=1, errors=6)


--Round 12 of Testing--
All error have been fixed
Battery error was from upgrade of tire meaning in the test data was out of date.
The tires was from poor understanding of the for loops writen

-Results-
Ran 19 tests in 0.002s
OK
