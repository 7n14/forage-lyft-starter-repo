# Forage Lyft Repo
This repository is the code base that I built for my Forage virtual internship for Lyft. I have 2 folders for different code, my code base with all the python files for the project (See folder called Code), and the model answer provided by Lyft (See folder called Model Answer Code).

Initially, I started this project off with a messy unfinished code base which was left to me by someone that had been moved to a different project and it was my goal to design and refactor the code to the requirements set out by Lyft. 

I started with designing a rough classes diagram (See pdf called Forage Lyft Task 1 New Architecture). Additionally, once I completed this I went to work to refactor the code base using my diagram as a guide. Once that was completed, I worked on some unit tests to debug the program and make sure all the logical is correct (See text file called units tests log.txt). Once that was complete, the Lyft needed to add a new requirement of tire wear, so they know when to service the rental car. Once I implemented the tire wear, I did more unit tests to verify the new code work with the old code. 

Then the project was complete. I had learned a lot from this virtual internship, first what work could be potentially like working a company as a back-end developer. Secondly, how to properly test my code with unit tests. Thirdly, how to plan a project in the future by myself or with a team.
